## Chapter 3: Efficient Data Ingestion Techniques

### What is Data Ingestion?

Data ingestion refers to the process of transferring data from its original source into a Data Lake for storage and analysis. It ensures data is available for various use cases, such as real-time analytics or machine learning.

---

### Methods of Data Ingestion

1. **Batch Ingestion**
   - Collects and moves data in chunks at scheduled intervals.
   - **Examples:** Monthly financial reports, daily sales data.
   - **Best For:** Large datasets that don’t require immediate processing.

2. **Real-Time Ingestion**
   - Streams data continuously as it is generated.
   - **Examples:** Fraud detection, live customer interactions.
   - **Best For:** Scenarios requiring instant analysis.

3. **Near-Real-Time Ingestion**
   - Processes data in micro-batches at short intervals.
   - **Examples:** Log monitoring, stock market analysis.
   - **Best For:** Balancing speed and resource efficiency.

### ETL vs. ELT: Which One to Choose?

| **Method**    | **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**               | **ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)**               |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Approach**  | Data is transformed before loading.              | Data is loaded first, then transformed.         |
| **Use Case**  | Ideal for structured data and strict governance. | Great for unstructured or semi-structured data. |
| **Example**   | Traditional data warehouses.                    | Modern Data Lakes leveraging processing power.  |

   - Types:
     - **Technical Metadata:** Details for developers (e.g., file structures).
     - **Business Metadata:** Ownership, purpose, and policies.
     - **Operational Metadata:** Tracks changes, lineage, and audits.

2. **Data Cataloging**
   - Centralized repository for easy data discovery.
   - **Benefits:** Enhances collaboration, supports compliance, and organizes data meaningfully.

3. **Data Lineage**
   - Tracks data from source to destination.
   - **Use Case:** Simplifies troubleshooting and ensures accuracy.

---

### Strategies for Effective Governance

- **Access Controls:**
  - Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to define permissions.
  - Example: Analysts access summarized data, while admins access raw data.

- **Compliance Management:**
  - Align with regulations like GDPR or HIPAA.
  - Use automated tools for policy enforcement and auditing.

- **Data Encryption and Masking:**
  - Encrypt data at rest and in transit.
  - Use masking to anonymize sensitive data.
