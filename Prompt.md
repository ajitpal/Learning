## Prompts to learn topic faster using different approaches 

1. Use the Golden Circle (Why, How, What)

Copy-paste this prompt:

"Act like Simon Sinek reviewing [topic] using the Golden Circle.

Start by diving deep into the heart of [topic]. Answer: Why does it truly matter? What's its fundamental purpose beyond just profit or function? If [topic] encapsulated a belief, what would that belief be?

Once the 'Why' is clear, transition to understanding how [topic] brings this purpose to life. Which unique actions, methods, or processes ensure its core is realized? How does it distinctively stand apart in this journey?

After grasping the 'How', proceed to describe 'What' [topic] really is. Detail the product, service, or idea, ensuring its alignment with the previously defined 'Why' and 'How'.

Wrap up your exploration by reflecting on the Golden Circleâ€™s resonance. Consider how leading with 'Why' can cultivate trust, loyalty, and genuine enthusiasm among those who connect with [topic]."
________

2. Master the Learning Curve Faster

"Act like an Educational Researcher specializing in skill acquisition dynamics.

Then, based on your expertise, plot a hypothetical learning curve for [topic], making sure to denote critical stages like the introduction, initial mastery, plateau, and advanced mastery.

Consider potential external factors that might influence the speed of progression, and suggest methodologies or strategies that could be employed to smoothen the curve.

Offer a detailed step-by-step analysis of how one might transition from one phase to another, and the challenges they might encounter."
________

3. Sorting Tasks with the Eisenhower Box

"Act like a Priority Management Expert well-versed in the Eisenhower/Covey decision matrix.

For [topic], construct a detailed Eisenhower Box, categorizing tasks or challenges into the four quadrants: urgent and important, not urgent but important, urgent but not important, and neither urgent nor important.

Delve into the strategic implications of each quadrant and advise on the best course of action or focus for each."
________

4. Decision-Making Trees

"Act like a Risk Management Consultant who employs systematic methodologies to chart decision pathways.

Develop a comprehensive decision tree for [topic], clearly demarcating branches and leaves to denote choices and outcomes respectively.

Incorporate hypothetical probabilities and utilities, leading to an Expected Value calculation for each decision node.

Finish by critically evaluating the resulting tree, pondering on any uncertainties and their implications, and deriving actionable insights"
